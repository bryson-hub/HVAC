**Model HVAC Project Goals**

The goals of this project are the following:
* Using fischertechniks and ROBOPro, build a prototype HVAC system to maintain a certain tolerance of temperature
* A light should indicate whether the fan or the lamp is on
* A control panel should count the number of seconds the fan or lamp has been on
* Fully comment all functions within the flowchart program

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Physical Construction

#### 1. Design Constraints - All design constraints are met and the prototype goes above and beyond.

My project includes the following elements to meet the design constraints:
* Element 1
* Element 2

#### 2. Repeatability of Function - The build is repeatable 100% of the time.

My build includes fischertechnik components to ensure repeatability. For example,...

### ROBOPro Programming Software

#### 1. Design Constraints - All design constraints are met and the prototype goes above and beyond.

My project includes the following elements to meet the design constraints:
* Element 1
* Element 2

Here are some pictures of my code:

#### 2. Repeatability of Function - The build is repeatable 100% of the time.

My build includes certain loops and functions to ensure program repeatability. For example,...

Here is where the code is implemented and integrating with my physical build:

# Model HVAC Project 
 
## The goals of this project are the following: 
 
Using fischertechniks and ROBOPro, build a prototype HVAC system to maintain a certain tolerance of temperature 
A light should indicate whether the fan or the lamp is on 
A control panel should count the number of seconds the fan or lamp has been on 
Fully comment all functions within the flowchart program 
Rubric Points 
Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation. 
 
### Physical Construction 
#### Design Constraints - All design constraints are met and the prototype goes above and beyond. 
My project includes the following elements to meet the design constraints: 
 
At least 1 lamp. 
At least 1 fan. 
 
#### Repeatability of Function - The build is repeatable 100% of the time. 
My build includes fischertechnik components to ensure repeatability. For example, ... 
 
### ROBOPro Programming Software 
#### Design Constraints - All design constraints are met and the prototype goes above and beyond. 
My project includes the following elements to meet the design constraints: 
 
A light indicates the function of the lamps and fan. 
There is a variety of settings for less cost and stays near a certain temperature. 
Here are some pictures of my code:

#### Repeatability of Function - The build is repeatable 100% of the time. 
My build includes certain loops and functions to ensure program repeatability. For example, ... 
 
Here is where the code is implemented and integrating with my physical build:
